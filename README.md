It's been awhile since I started following TOP. As a full-time employee, I found myself too lucky that I still got time to study. Still on my way searching for my true passion, as so far I got nothing but admiration for Coders and Developers in the world. Those people are simply amazing with limitless intelligence. Hopefully one day I can proudly call myself as one of them.
Still a long way to go, but thank you TOP for this opportunity!
NOW IT'S TIME DO START CODING :)
